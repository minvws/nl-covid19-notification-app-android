This happens if you\'ve spent at least 15 minutes near someone who has coronavirus. This could be one or more people. But only if they also use the app.\n\nWhether or not you get a notification depends on the strength of the Bluetooth signal and the duration of your encounter. Did someone cycle past you on the street? Then you won\'t get a notification later. Yes, the Bluetooth signal was strong because you were near each other. But only for a short time. So your risk of infection is very low.\n\nWere you near someone on the train or in the office? Then you could get a notification later.

    <string name="faq_location_permission">Why do my location services need to be turned on?</string>
    <string name="faq_technical">How does the app work?</string>
    <string name="faq_reason_paragraph_1">"The app can quickly warn you after you've been near someone who has coronavirus. Even before you show symptoms. Because it's possible to have coronavirus and be contagious without having symptoms. "</string>
    <string name="faq_reason_paragraph_2">If you get a warning through the app, you can get tested. Furthermore, the advice is to stay home. So you prevent unknowingly infecting people in your environment.</string>
    <string name="faq_reason_paragraph_3">"Did you get tested, and do you have coronavirus? Together with the GGD, you can warn people who were near you for an extended amount of time. Including people you don't know. For example people you encountered in a restaurant, cinema, or waiting room. As long as these people also use the app. "</string>
    <string name="faq_reason_paragraph_4">Thanks to CoronaMelder we can act quicker and prevent new infections. Only together can we get coronavirus under control.</string>
    <string name="faq_location_paragraph_1">"No. Using Bluetooth, the app only sees if you're near other people who also have the app. Bluetooth isn't linked to your location, so the app never sees where you are.\n\nBluetooth only wirelessly connects 2 devices that are near each other. Like your phone and a speaker, or a pair of wireless headphones.\n\nThe app can estimate the distance between 2 phones using the strength of the Bluetooth signal. "</string>
    <string name="faq_anonymous_paragraph_1">The app exchanges random codes with other phones. These codes don\'t include any personal or location data. The code exchange happens when you\'re near a person who also has the app.</string>
    <string name="faq_anonymous_paragraph_2">Was this person later found to have coronavirus? Together with the GGD, they can add their code to a list of codes of infected people. By doing so the infection can be confirmed.\n\nAfter this, a notification is sent to all people who have these codes on their phones. This notification only says when they\'ve been near an infected person. Not who this person is and where they\'ve encountered them.</string>
    <string name="faq_upload_keys_paragraph_1">You can only send a notification to others if you were tested and have coronavirus. In this case, you\'ll get a call from the GGD with the test results. \n\nDuring this call a GGD employee checks your GGD key. You can find this key in the app. Using this method we make sure only people who are really infected can send notifications to others.</string>
    <string name="faq_upload_keys_paragraph_2">After your GGD key is checked, you can share the codes your phone has sent to other phones in the last 14 days.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By doing so, the people who were near you while you were contagious are notified. But only if these people also use the app.</string>
    <string name="faq_bluetooth_paragraph_1">"Yes, but the signal would be very weak. Bluetooth works best when your phone is in the same room as another person's phone.\n\nSo the chance of you getting your neighbours' Bluetooth signal is very low.\n\nThat also means you probably won't get a notification if your neighbour has coronavirus and you haven't been in the same room."</string>
    <string name="faq_power_usage_paragraph_1">The app uses Bluetooth Low Energy — a special kind of Bluetooth that only uses a tiny amount of power. How fast this drains your battery depends on your phone.</string>
    <string name="faq_deletion_paragraph_1">"You can delete the Bluetooth files saved by the app yourself. Press the button below and then press &lt;strong&gt;Delete random IDs&lt;/strong&gt;.\n\nIf you don't want the app to save new Bluetooth data, delete the app."</string>
    <string name="faq_deletion_button">Open Settings</string>
    <string name="faq_location_permission_paragraph_1">CoronaMelder doesn\'t know where you are. However, your location settings need to be turned on for the app to work. That might sound a little strange. Here\'s how it works:\n\nCoronaMelder uses \'Bluetooth scanning\'. This is a different technology from the one used to, for example connect to a pair of wireless headphones. It\'s a special kind of Bluetooth that only uses a tiny amount of power. Using Bluetooth scanning the app exchanges random codes with nearby phones.\n\nSome apps (not CoronaMelder) use Bluetooth scanning to determine your location. That\'s why your location settings always need to be turned on to use Bluetooth scanning. Even if an app isn\'t using your location.\n\nImportant to remember: CoronaMelder can never access your location. From Android version 11 your location settings will never have to be turned on.</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_toolbar_title">Technical explanation</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_header_1">1. The app makes a unique code for each phone</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_paragraph_2">This code doesn\'t include any information about you or your phone. The code is completely random and changes every 15 minutes.</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_header_3">2. Phones only exchange codes when they\'re near each other</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_paragraph_4">If the person you’re near also has the app, then your phones use Bluetooth Low Energy to exchange codes. This way, the app knows which phones were near you. The app doesn\'t know who the phones belong to. And it doesn\'t know where you were.</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_header_5">3. If someone has coronavirus, they can put their codes on a list</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_paragraph_6">This list only contains the codes of infected people. All codes older than 14 days are automatically deleted. An infected person can add their codes to this list. To do so, they need to give a special code, called a GGD key, to the GGD. This guarantees the added codes actually belong to someone who has coronavirus.</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_header_7">4. Each phone checks whether it has seen the codes on the list before</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_paragraph_8">A few times a day, the app checks the list which has codes of infected people. And it compares these codes with the codes saved on your phone. This is how the app sees whether you\'ve had a higher risk of infection.</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_header_9">5. You get a notification if an infected person\'s codes are on your phone</string>
    <string name="faq_technical_paragraph_10">This notification tells you when you\'ve been near an infected person. Not who this person is, or where you\'ve run into them. The app lets you know what you can do next. Your own codes aren\'t on the list of infected codes. They\'re saved on your phone for 14 days.</string>

    <string name="faq_pause_paragraph_3">It\'s mostly not recommended to pause the app. Because you might forget to turn it on again. You can pause the app in certain moments. For example, when you\'re near (potential) corona patients and you\'re wearing the appropriate medical protection.</string>
    <string name="faq_interoperability">Does CoronaMelder work with apps from other countries?</string>
    <string name="faq_interoperability_paragraph_1">CoronaMelder works with various apps from other Europeans countries. Like the German, Irish, and Italian apps.</string>
    <string name="faq_interoperability_paragraph_2">Imagine you\'ve been near a user of the German Corona-Warn-App for an extended period of time. This person is later tested in Germany and turns out to have corona. If this person shares their codes with the German GGD, you will get a notification through CoronaMelder. This also goes the other way around. Because the corona apps work together, you only need to have one app turned on.</string>
    <string name="faq_interoperability_paragraph_3">From November 30th 2020, CoronaMelder will check the codes of users from other countries every day. Because of this, the app will use more mobile data than before. You can set the app to only check with Wi-Fi if you\'ve been near someone who has corona. Do this through &lt;strong&gt;Settings&lt;/strong&gt; on the main screen.</string>
